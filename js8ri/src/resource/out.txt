the
evening
sky
over
the
northern
hemisphere
treated
stargazers
to
a
once-in-a-lifetime
illusion
on
dec.
21
as
the
solar
system’s
two
biggest
planets
appeared
to
meet
in
a
celestial
alignment
that
astronomers
call
the
“great
conjunction.”
the
rare
spectacle
resulted
from
a
near
convergence
of
the
orbits
of
jupiter
and
saturn
that
happened
to
coincide
with
the
dec.
21
winter
solstice,
the
shortest
day
of
the
year.
for
those
able
to
observe
the
alignment
in
clear
skies,
the
two
frozen-gas
spheres
appeared
closer
and
more
vibrant
than
at
any
time
in
800
years.
jupiter
–
the
brighter
and
larger
of
the
pair
–
has
been
gradually
nearing
saturn
in
the
sky
for
weeks
as
the
two
planets
proceed
around
the
sun,
each
in
its
own
lane
of
an
enormous
celestial
racetrack,
said
henry
throop,
an
astronomer
at
national
aeronautics
and
space
administration
headquarters
in
washington.
at
the
point
of
convergence,
jupiter
and
saturn
appeared
to
be
just
one-tenth
of
a
degree
apart,
roughly
equivalent
to
the
thickness
of
a
dime
held
at
arm’s
length.
in
reality,
of
course,
the
planets
remained
hundreds
of
millions
of
kilometers
apart,
according
to
nasa.
a
conjunction
of
the
two
planets
takes
place
about
once
every
20
years.
but
the
last
time
they
came
as
close
together
in
the
sky
as
on
dec.
21
was
in
1623
and
it
was
during
daylight,
making
it
invisible
from
most
places
on
earth.
